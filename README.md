# Message of the day (message-of-the-day)
A database of beautiful message for each day.

In movies, novels, song lyrics, we have lots of well created, touched and polished dialogues and statements.
And we have lots of creations to study and explore, too.
So here is the plan for this repo:
for each day, having some dialogues or statements from a movie, a novel, or a song lyric, to a specfic date.
To express the beauty of human being's creation, and to dedicate it to that specific day.
